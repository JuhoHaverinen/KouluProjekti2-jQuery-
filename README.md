# Introduction 
This is the second school project made in Savonia Code Academy as a group of three students.
The purpose of this was to make a booking website for an imaginary vacation resort.
The project's database was made with MySQL workbench, frontend with jQuery and Bootstrap, backend with nodeJS.

# My Contribution to the project
Contributed to the database planning and creation.
I started with the front page but we switched roles and I made at least 80% of the admin page.
For the front page I made all the pop-up windows concerning the reservation confirmation and the sending the invoice to the booker's email
which unfornately doesn't work anymore because the solution I found back then was set to be expired in a couple of months because of some upcoming changes which I don't remember anymore.

# What you can do?
Reserve a cabin that is free at your selected date and which fits your party size.
On admin page(u: admin, p: admin1) you can add/modify/delete areas, cabins and additional services.
List/modify/delete reservations. List/search invoices, reservation reports and additional services reports. 
Loggin out as Admin actually logs you out and it's not possible to get back trying to go back one page from browser.

# Nice to know
It's recommended to run the program from example visual studio code's live server after nodemon start.js to make sure everything works as intended.
